It also enables user to remove tasks including the active and completed task, and remove all the completed tasks at once.

In the web app also provides switch of color mode that can be used by user to switch between dark and light mode. the task data is saved in local storage, so even when the user refresh the browser, it will still be there. I build this app using React.Js, Next.Js, and styled it using Chakra-UI. Challenging myself more in switching color mode and saving up data locally.",
